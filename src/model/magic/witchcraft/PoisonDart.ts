If the attack beats the targetâ€™s Armour it causes no damage, but he loses one of his two standard actions per activation for the rest of the game, or until healed by either a Heal spell or a Healing Potion. The remaining action does not have to be the otherwise compulsory movement. Multiple Poison Darts against the same figure have no effect.',
