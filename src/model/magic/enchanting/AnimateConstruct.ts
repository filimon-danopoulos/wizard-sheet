If the spell is successfully cast, the construct immediately becomes a member of the warband, taking the place of a soldier. A spellcaster may declare that he is attempting to animate a construct of any size (Small, Medium or Large â€“ see Chapter 6: Bestiary), but the larger the construct, the harder it is to animate, so the following modifiers are applied to his roll to cast the spell: Small -0, Medium -3, Large -6.
